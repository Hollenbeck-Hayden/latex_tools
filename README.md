# latex_tools

A small set of tools I use for creating and processing LaTeX files.

new_notes - just copies a default template with common packages and file loaded \\
pdf_latex_clean - processes a LaTeX document and produces the corresponding PDF file. Can be editted
		  to use LuaTex \\
tex.snippets - UltiSnippets file for quickly using snippets in vim \\
knmacros.sty - Personal macros for LaTeX files \\
