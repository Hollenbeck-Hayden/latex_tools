# latex_tools

A small set of tools I use for creating and processing LaTeX files.

* `new_notes` - just copies a default template with common packages and file loaded   
* `pdf_latex_clean` - processes a LaTeX document and produces the corresponding PDF file. Can be editted
		  to use LuaTex   
* `tex.snippets` - UltiSnippets file for quickly using snippets in vim   


Installation:

Just run `install.sh` to make symbolic links to `$HOME/bin` for the scripts, and to install `tex.snippets`
to `$HOME/.vim/UltiSnips`. 

To Do:
* Update ranger commands for opening latex files
* Add vim commands for compiling latex files
* Add bibtex outline
